# Loginator
## 3 Hour React App for a simple login system

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Steps to run:

## Install Dependencies
### `npm install npm i --legacy-peer-deps`

`--legacy-peer-deps` is needed because react was downgraded to support `react-easy-state`

## Run App
### `npm start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## TODO
1. Api request to check if user exists.
2. Implement Logout
3. Improve login UI
4. Improve password validation (Contain numbers and special characters)

## Challenges
1. React easy state is not supported on react 18.
2. React router couldn't redirect to dashboard route.

## Disclaimer
1. App was built in 3 hours.
2. Final piece of app functionality was committed few seconds to midnight ðŸ¥²
3. ReadMe was updated ~12 minutes after midnight.
